/**
 * @title ERC900 Credits-based staking implementation
 * @dev See https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-900.md
 *
 * Notice that credits aren't lost when tokens are unstaked--only when credits are spent.
 * This means that after the initial lock in duration expires, a user can re-stake those tokens
 *  for more credits.
 * Another important note: spendCredits can only be called by the contract's owner. This
 *  is meant to be another smart contract. For example, the smart contract can offer call
 *  spendCredits to reduce a user's credit balance in place of spending real tokens.
