# Codex Protocol | ERC 900 Contracts

## Staking
This repo has a few different takes on staking. The main principle that these contracts follow is that staking is used as a discount mechanism using an ERC-20 token for operations on a protocol.

For example, at Codex Protocol we're using this concept so that users can stake CodexCoin (CODX) to receive discounts when creating Codex Records. See the repo here for a live example: https://github.com/codex-protocol/contract.codex-registry.
